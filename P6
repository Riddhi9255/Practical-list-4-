Write a C++ program to calculate difference between Manufacture 
year and expiry year using pass object as function argument.
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Product {
public:
    int manufactureYear;
    int expiryYear;

    Product(int mYear, int eYear) : manufactureYear(mYear), expiryYear(eYear) {}

    int calculateDifference() {
        return expiryYear - manufactureYear;
    }
};

int main() {
    int manufactureYear, expiryYear;

    cout << "Enter the manufacture year: ";
    cin >> manufactureYear;
    cout << "Enter the expiry year: ";
    cin >> expiryYear;

    Product product(manufactureYear, expiryYear);

    int difference = product.calculateDifference();

    cout << "The difference between manufacture year and expiry year is: " << difference << " years" << endl;

    return 0;
}
